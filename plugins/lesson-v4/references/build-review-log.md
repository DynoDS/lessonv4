# Build review log

Lesson runs append genuine engine findings here when a writable source
checkout resolves; the improvement pass reads them, fixes the engine, and
records what became of each entry. A run that cannot reach this file writes a
`pending-build-review-log.md` beside its run report instead, and the next
improvement pass folds those in.

## 2026-08-30 — Year 4 Maths: 4-digit ± 3-digit numbers

- Worksheet `column-method-grid` ignores both `showHeadings: true` and explicit
  `columns` arrays in rendered output; place-value headings remain absent
  although the spec requests them.
  *Addressed 30 Aug 2026: `showHeadings` is now rendered and measured
  (`worksheet-html/src/helpers/forms.js`), with the letters derived from the
  numbers' own width; regression test `column-method-headings.test.js`.*
- Working-wall no-photo cards retain the photo-column width, producing a
  substantial blank right-side band; the retained builder has no output-only
  override.
  *Investigated 30 Aug 2026: does not reproduce - the renderer reserves no
  photo column on a no-photo card, and the rebuilt page uses the full panel
  width. The band was the ragged right edge of left-set steps; the reviewer's
  dead-space standard now names that rag as not-a-fault
  (`agents/visual-reviewer.md`).*
- Working-wall ordinary spaces can collapse at particular line joins;
  non-breaking spaces restored canonical visible wording.
  *Investigated 30 Aug 2026: does not reproduce - the same spec with ordinary
  spaces renders correct spacing, and NBSP has the same printed width as a
  space, so the "fix" could not have changed the page. The likelier fault was
  pixel transcription at review DPI; wording-drift findings now require
  text-layer or 300 DPI confirmation (`agents/visual-consistency-reviewer.md`).*

## 2026-08-30 — Pending helpers from the batch

- The `map` growth (seven-continent world with Antarctica, globe-to-flat,
  continents-and-oceans worksheet form) was installed and proven on
  30 Aug 2026: the shipped `world.png` genuinely omits Antarctica, which had
  blocked the whole continents lesson.
- The `column-method-grid` drop-in was reviewed and NOT installed: its
  worksheet half hard-codes four Th/H/T/O columns, which would regress the
  2-digit grids the engine's own helper (now with `showHeadings`) derives
  correctly, and its slide half needs the same width-derivation before it is
  safe. Rework the drop-in before installing.
- The `water-cycle-diagram` drop-in remains waiting in its run folder; the
  substitute-picture route delivered that lesson, so installation stays a
  deliberate choice via `/install-helper`.

## 2026-08-30 — Year 4 PSHE: The importance of boundaries in friendships

(Folded in from the run's pending log entry.)

- Deck slide 6 still had overlapping pathway outcome boxes after the permitted
  owner repair and confirmation round (`DECK-001`).
- Printable Chrome packages were unavailable, so differentiated worksheet HTML
  and the answer key were delivered without a PDF or page-fit verification.
  *Addressed 30 Aug 2026: the preflight was passed as `ready` on a guess; the
  playbook now names the exact preflight command and output-to-state mapping
  (`skills/make-lesson/playbook-lite.md`).*
